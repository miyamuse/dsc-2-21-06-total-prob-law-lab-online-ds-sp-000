    "## Introduction \n",
    "In this lab, we shall look at the law of total probability. In probability theory, the law (or formula) of total probability is a fundamental rule relating **marginal probabilities** to conditional probabilities. It expresses the total probability of an outcome which can be realized via several distinct events, hence the name.\n",

    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Understand and explain the concept of event space and partitioning \n",
    "* State the law of total probabilities based on a partitioned event space\n",
    "* Understand and able to perform partitioning based on known and unknown probabilities to solve a problem"
